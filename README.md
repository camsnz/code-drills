## Learn to code exercises

#### JS Function drills
Setup first:
```
cd js
npm i
npm test
```

Tests should run, and (among other things) should print out results like:
```
    Expected: 34.8
    Received: NaN
```

These tests do not pass. Open up Exercise01.js and follow the instructions.
Confirm your work is correct by running the provided tests.
